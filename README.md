## HW 5 - Problem 5
See the actions tab to see the integrated frontend unit tests

Note: There is a console error durring the tests as the front end is trying to communicate with a non-existant backend. We have intentionally left out our backend as we were having navigation issues with both the frontend and backend code together and trying to do continuous integration. (We have checked with Professor Zimmeck and he said it was fine to just include frontend files for problem 5 CI testing)
